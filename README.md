# FEM-Implementation

## Introduction
This algorithm implements Finite Elements Method (1D) for equation: (a(x)*u'(x))' + b(x)*u'(x) + c(x)*u(x) = f(x). Omega = (0,1). a(x), b(x), c(x), f(x) are variable functions and the boundary conditions are: -a(0)u'(0)+βu(0) = γ and u(1) = uR (β and γ are also variables). We used python bibliotecs: math, numpy and scipy. Enjoy!

Used technologies are:
* Python 3
* Math library
* Numpy library
